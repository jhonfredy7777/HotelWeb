#  Sol y Mar - Web App for Hotel Reservations

Web application developed with Django to manage reservations, rooms, and guests at a beach resort hotel. It offers a simple interface for users and an efficient administrative dashboard for staff.

The project was practically finished when I decided to make a repository and work with git. That means that the first commits will contain the majority of my work. The main focus now will be to improve the base.html layout so that the footer is not covered by the content in the header.
